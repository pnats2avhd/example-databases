# Example Databases

This is an example database set written for the [AVHD-AS / P.NATS Phase 2 Processing Chain](https://github.com/pnats2avhd/processing-chain).

## Types of Databases

During the ITU-T/VQEG project, the databases were assigned as "Long" or "Short". Short databases used conditions which were homogenous during the whole video, only one resolution and bitrate per video clip of 8-10 s. Long database conditions could contain multiple bitrates and resolutions in an adaptive pattern and also stalling events.

The supplied test specification `.yaml`-files correspond to one of each of these Long and Short test databases.

## Database YAML

Each database is mainly specified by a `.yaml` file that lists:

- The source files used for encoding
- The settings for encoding audio and video
- The HRC settings for "stitching" together different encodings

See the example YAML files in the respective subfolders.

## Utilities

This repository also contains tools for creating and analysing database specifications.
