# Example databases

Test databases to run with the processing chain. During the P.NATS ITU/VQEG project the databases were assigned as "Long" or "Short". Short databases used conditions which were homogenous during the whole video, only one resolution and bitrate per video clip of 8-10 s. Long database conditions could contain multiple bitrates and resolutions in an adaptive pattern and also stalling events.  
The supplied test specification .yaml-files corresponds to one of each of these Long and Short test databases. 
This repository also contains tools for creating and analysing database specifications.
